    <h2>This flute was superseded in 1847 by Boehm’s second design, with its experimentally evolved cylindrical bore (having a contracting or parabolic head)—the flute since used. The loss of a certain depth and intimacy of tone of the old conical flute has been offset by gains in evenness of notes, complete expressive control throughout the compass at all dynamic levels, and almost limitless technical flexibility.
    A modern Boehm-system flute (pitched in C with the range c′–c‴) is made of wood (cocuswood or blackwood) or metal (silver or a substitute). It is 26.5 inches (67 cm) long, with a bore of about 0.75 inch, built in three sections. The body, or middle joint, and the foot joint (sometimes made in one piece) have the note holes (13 at least), which are controlled by an interlocking mechanism of padded key plates hinged on a longitudinal axis. The bore narrows in the head joint, which contains the mouth hole, and is closed just above the hole by a cork or fibre stopper; it is open at the foot end. Other flute sizes include the piccolo, the alto flute (in England sometimes called the bass flute) in G, the bass (or contrabass) flute an octave below the flute, and the various sizes used in military flute bands, generally pitched in D♭ and A♭.
